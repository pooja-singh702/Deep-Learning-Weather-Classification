Conclusions:
By adding an extra Max-Pooling after each convulational layer, keeping everything else from Arch 1 constant, accuracy for train and test data set increased substantially from ~22% to ~81% for test data whereas reducing a layer and one max pooling after 2 convulations decreased accuracy marginally.

Adding more convulational layers and max-pooling after each Conv will increase accuracy of model.
